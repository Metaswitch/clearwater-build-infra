# Caller must set the following:
# DEB_COMPONENT       - name of overall component for manifest
#                       (e.g., sprout)
# DEB_MAJOR_VERSION   - major version number for deb package (e.g., 1.0)
# DEB_NAMES           - space-separated base names of deb packages
#                       (e.g., sprout sprout-dbg)
# DEB_ARCH (optional) - override deb architecture (defaults to this
#                       host's native architecture). E.g., set to all
#                       for arch-independent debs.

# Caller may also set the following:
# REPO_DIR            - path to repository to move Debian packages to (default
#                       is unset, meaning don't move packages)
# REPO_SERVER         - username and server to scp Debian pacakges to (default
#                       is unset, meaning move packages locally)
# CW_SIGNED           - whether to sign the generated Debian repository (default
#                       is unset, meaning don't sign; set to Y to sign).
#                       IMPORTANT: this signs the repo itself, which means that
#                       *all* packages in it are marked authentic, not just the
#                       ones we built just now. See http://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt
#                       for details.
